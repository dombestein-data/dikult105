If you're reading this, you're most likely trying to read the code behind the updated portfolio website.

The code for this website is within /portfolioWebsite/v2, v1 is the very first idea I had. Glad I dropped that.

within the v2 folder, the entire project is rather straight forward. All page files (.html) are at the root of the project, with css files and scripts being split into their own folders.
within the /scripts folders, there is another folder called /data which contains only a file called projInfo.js. This is a core file for the projects page to work as expected as all the info in the project modal (the box that shows up when you click a project on the projects page) is fetched from this very file.

All assets are, as expected, in a standalone /assets folder.
