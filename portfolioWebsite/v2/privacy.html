        <p class="privacy-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Dombestein Data</strong> ("I", "me", "we") collects,
          uses and protects personal data in connection with this website and the services offered.
          The goal is to be transparent, understandable, and respect your rights under applicable
          data protection law, including the EU/EEA General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy covers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Visitors to the website dombesteindata.net and related subpages;</li>
          <li>People who contact Dombestein Data (for example by e-mail or via a contact form);</li>
          <li>Clients and collaboration partners in connection with web development and software projects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Who is responsible for your data?</h2>
        <p>
          The data controller for the processing described in this policy is:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dombestein Data</strong><br />
          E-mail: <a href="mailto:isak@dombesteindata.net">isak@dombesteindata.net</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          For some client projects (for example, systems developed for Ad Fontes), Dombestein Data may also
          act as a <strong>data processor</strong> on behalf of that client. In those cases, the client is the
          data controller, and a separate Data Processing Agreement (DPA) will apply in addition to this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>3. What data is collected?</h2>
        <p>
          The amount of personal data collected is intentionally kept to a minimum. Depending on how you
          interact with Dombestein Data, the following categories may be processed:
        </p>
        <h3>3.1 Contact information</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Name</li>
          <li>E-mail address</li>
          <li>Other information you choose to include in a message</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Usage and technical data</h3>
        <p>
          When you visit this website, basic technical information is processed automatically:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>IP address (short-term, primarily for security and error logging);</li>
          <li>Browser type and operating system;</li>
          <li>Pages visited and time of visit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This information is largely handled by the hosting and infrastructure providers (for example
          Cloudflare) as part of providing a secure and stable service.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Client and project data</h3>
        <p>
          For clients and collaboration partners, additional information may be processed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact persons and roles;</li>
          <li>Project-related communication and documentation;</li>
          <li>Billing and payment details where relevant.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Purposes and legal bases</h2>
        <p>
          Personal data is only processed when there is a legal basis under GDPR. The main purposes and
          corresponding legal bases are:
        </p>
        <h3>4.1 Responding to enquiries and communication</h3>
        <p>
          When you contact Dombestein Data, your contact details and message are used to respond and follow up.
          The legal basis is GDPR Article 6(1)(f) - <em>legitimate interest</em> in answering enquiries and
          maintaining contact with potential and existing clients.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Entering into and fulfilling agreements</h3>
        <p>
          For client projects, personal data may be processed to enter into, manage, and fulfil contracts.
          The legal basis is GDPR Article 6(1)(b) - <em>necessary for the performance of a contract</em> or
          to take steps at your request before entering into a contract.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Bookings, notifications and service messages</h3>
        <p>
          In projects like the Ad Fontes booking system, e-mail notifications are used to confirm bookings,
          notify about changes, and send responses to requests. The legal basis is GDPR Article 6(1)(b)
          where the communication is necessary to provide the service, and Article 6(1)(f) - legitimate
          interest in keeping users informed about the status of their request.
        </p>

        <h3>4.4 Security, troubleshooting and abuse prevention</h3>
        <p>
          Technical logs and limited IP data may be processed to maintain security, prevent misuse, and
          troubleshoot errors. The legal basis is GDPR Article 6(1)(f) - <em>legitimate interest</em> in
          protecting the service, users and infrastructure.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Sources of data</h2>
        <p>
          Most personal data is obtained directly from you, for example when you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Send an e-mail or use a contact form;</li>
          <li>Act as a contact person for a client project;</li>
          <li>Use a system developed and operated by Dombestein Data on behalf of a client.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In some cases, contact information may be provided by your employer or student organisation if they
          designate you as a contact person in a project.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Sharing and use of processors</h2>
        <p>
          Personal data is not sold and is only shared where necessary to provide services or when required by law.
          Trusted third-party providers (data processors) are used for hosting, databases, e-mail delivery and
          similar infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typical categories of processors include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hosting and infrastructure (e.g. Cloudflare Pages, Supabase);</li>
          <li>Transactional e-mail (e.g. Resend, when configured);</li>
          <li>Version control and project management (e.g. GitHub, not normally processing end-user data).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With each processor, appropriate data protection agreements are in place, and only the minimum necessary
          personal data is shared.
        </p>

        <h2>7. International transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Some service providers are based outside the EU/EEA, or may process data in countries such as the USA.
          In these cases, one or more of the following safeguards are relied on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data centres located within the EU/EEA where available;</li>
          <li>EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and supplementary measures;</li>
          <li>Provider-specific commitments, such as the Microsoft EU Data Boundary for certain services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For more information about these providers and links to their documentation, see the
          relevant project-specific documentation or contact Dombestein Data.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Personal data is kept only for as long as necessary for the purposes described above, or as required by
          law (for example, accounting rules).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            General enquiries are normally kept for a limited period, then deleted when follow-up is complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            Project-related data is retained for the duration of the project and a reasonable period afterwards
            (for example for documentation, error tracing or contractual obligations).
          </li>
          <li>
            Legal documentation such as invoices may be stored for up to 5 years in line with Norwegian
            bookkeeping requirements.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Security</h2>
        <p>
          Appropriate technical and organisational measures are used to protect personal data, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use of reputable hosting providers with strong security practices;</li>
          <li>Encryption of data in transit (HTTPS);</li>
          <li>Access control and principle of least privilege for accounts and tools;</li>
          <li>Regular updates of software and dependencies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          No system can be completely risk-free, but the aim is to keep risk at a reasonable and proportional level.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Under GDPR, you have several rights regarding your personal data. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Right of access</strong> - to know what data is processed about you and to receive a copy;</li>
          <li><strong>Right to rectification</strong> - to have incorrect or incomplete data corrected;</li>
          <li><strong>Right to erasure</strong> - to request deletion of data in certain situations;</li>
          <li><strong>Right to restriction</strong> - to request that processing is temporarily limited;</li>
          <li><strong>Right to object</strong> - to object to processing based on legitimate interests;</li>
          <li><strong>Right to data portability</strong> - for some data processed on the basis of consent or contract.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To exercise your rights, contact Dombestein Data at
          <a href="mailto:isak@dombesteindata.net">isak@dombesteindata.net</a>. You may be asked to provide
          information to confirm your identity before your request is handled.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Complaints</h2>
        <p>
          If you believe your personal data has been processed in violation of data protection rules, you have the
          right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. In Norway, this is:
        </p>

        </p>

        <h2>12. Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, for example if services change or if legal
          requirements are updated. The latest version will always be available on this page, with the
